# Basic Analysis Pipeline


A basic analysis pipeline [can be found here](https://github.com/WALIII/FinchScope/wiki/Analysis-Guide)

This code serves as a basic analysis pipeline for extracting fluorescence time series traces from the .mov files generated from the FreedomScopes. While this is a basic workflow, the exported .mov files can be used with any analysis software.
