#FreedomScope Project
============

##Overview
The FreedomScope project aims to develop a modular in-vivo ABA (awake, behaving animal) optophysiology rig, with a transparent acquisition and analysis pipeline. The goal is to produce a customizable and scaleable single-photon fluorescent imaging platform that takes advantage of developing open-source analysis platforms.

The project is now active in the Gardner lab, (Pub pending...) but documentation is still sparse on some things.

####Components:
###Finchscope
The FinchScope is a lightweight (<2g) dual channel, lightweight microscope for biological imaging- Designed specifically for monitoring the neural activity (via genetically encoded calcium indicators) of zebra finches while they sing their courtship songs.

###ActiveComm
The ActiveCom is a low noise active(driven by a motor and sensor) commutator designed for ABA electrophysiology and optophysiology.
