============

## Overview
The FinchScope project aims to provide a modular in-vivo ABA (awake, behaving animal) optophysiology rig, with a transparent acquisition and analysis pipeline. The goal is to produce a customizable and scaleable single-photon fluorescent imaging microscope system that takes advantage of developing open-source analysis platforms.

The project was initially developed in the Gardner Lab, for multi-month imaging of neural activity in songbirds. It has since been adapted for rodents.

#### Components:


### Finchscope Microscope

The FinchScope is a lightweight wireless-capable microscope for biological imaging- Designed specifically for monitoring the neural activity (via genetically encoded calcium indicators) of zebra finches while they sing their courtship songs. You can find the Construction and Assembly Guide for [the Microscope](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Assembly-Guide), As well as a for the [Data Acquisition Box (DAQ)](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/DAQ-Guide).  Also, we have a [Guide Through a Basic Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Analysis-Guide)


### ActiveComm
The ActiveCom is a low noise active(driven by a motor and sensor) commutator designed for ABA electrophysiology and optophysiology.
